Hello! This is a 2D game in Python where you control a spaceship and have to shot asteroids and survive by not being hit by them!

While this project was born from the Build Asteroids using Python and Pygame course in Boot.Dev, I have decided to add more personal touches to make the game really playable and fun. =)

Work in progress!

Here are the credits for the musics I've added to the game:
